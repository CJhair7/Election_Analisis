# Election_Analisis

## Project overview
A Colorado Board of Elections gave me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Precinct Audit

This was done to analize voter turnout in different regions of the State.

It must be noted that:
-The county with the highest voter turnout was Denver County with 82.8%
-Followed by Jefferson County with 10.5%
-Lastly, Arapahoe County with 6.7%

## Election Audit Summary
This script is useful for determining what percentage of voters chose each candidate variouse electoral regions.
One may add as many candidates as needed and as many electoral areas as there may be.
In another election, the script can be modified to also take into account:
- The politial tendencies (democrat or republican) of an area by adding a fourth collum with the party affiliation.
- The order preferences (third, fourth, ect.) of multiple candidates in a certain region.
